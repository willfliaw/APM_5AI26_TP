\chapter{Results} \label{chap:res}

Present the results of your experiments, including any tables or graphs that compare the performance of the NVAR kernel with other methods.

Highlight the performance differences between the NVAR kernel and existing kernels (e.g., reservoir-based kernels or elastic measures like Dynamic Time Warping).

Interpret the results: Did the NVAR kernel perform as expected? How did it compare to other kernels in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability?

Discuss any insights gained from the experiments, such as the effect of hyperparameter settings (e.g., number of lags, polynomial order).
