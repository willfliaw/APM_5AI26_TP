# Instructions

## Select a Paper (before - Oct 15) and choose your binôme.

- Choose a recent machine learning paper from reputable sources (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS, ICLR, …) from 2015:
  - Websites of interest:
    - [NeurIPS](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/)
    - [ICML and AISTATS](https://proceedings.mlr.press/)
    - [ICLR](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc)
- Ensure the paper presents a novel idea, method, application, and code !
- [Send email to me](mailto:florence.dalche@telecom-paris.fr) with Email subject: [Kernel Machines] so that I can check the adequation of this paper with respect to this course, no later than Oct 15.

## Read the Paper Thoroughly:

- Focus on understanding the core concepts, methodologies, results, and conclusions.
- Position the contribution in terms of novelty regarding the key elements of ML methodology: new task definition, hypothesis space /architecture,  loss function,  regularization, optimization,  evaluation metrics,…

## Identify the Context:

- Note the problem the paper addresses and its relevance in the field of machine learning.
- Consider the state-of-the-art methods prior to this work and how the proposed method fits into the landscape.

## Analyze the Pros:

- Innovation: Discuss the novelty of the approach
  - What makes it unique compared to previous works?
- Methodology: Evaluate the soundness of the proposed methods
  - Are they well-justified and robust?
- Results: Analyze the results
  - Are they convincing?
  - Do they demonstrate clear advantages over existing approaches?
- Applications: Consider the practical implications
  - Does the work have real-world applications?
  - How impactful is it?
- Clarity: Evaluate the clarity of the writing and presentation
  - Is the paper well-organized and easy to follow?

## Analyze the Cons:

- Limitations: Identify any limitations in the proposed methods
  - Are there specific scenarios where the approach might fail?
- Reproducibility: Assess whether the methods and results are reproducible
  - Are sufficient details provided for others to replicate the study?
- Evaluation Metrics: Critique the choice of evaluation metrics
  - Are they appropriate for the problem being addressed?

## Prepare, run and analyze novel numerical experiments

- Conduct your own experiments on a **new dataset** neither used in the paper nor in the provided code library, or define a toy dataset, study the behavior of the proposed approach on this new set.

## Write the report

Please Indicate the title and the name of the authors, and publication venue in the first page together with your names.

- Introduction: Briefly introduce the paper and its significance.
- Pros: Outline the strengths identified in your analysis, providing evidence and examples from the paper.
- Cons: Discuss the weaknesses, supported by specific points from the text.
- Numerical experiments: conduct your own experiments with a new dataset not used in the paper or provided library, or define a toy dataset, study  the behavior of the proposed approach on this new set.
- Conclusion: Summarize your findings and suggest areas for future research or improvements.

# Add your code and a notebook for running your experiments

- Grading: the project will be graded on 15/20  (other exam is the practical session): 60% for the report content except experiments and 40% for the experimental analysis.
- Deadline: Nov, 8th midnight (Project to submitted only in the IP Paris Moodle)
- Presentation: there will be no oral presentation except if I find that you report and experiments are not at the required level. In this case we will plan a remote oral presentation.
